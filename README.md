THE HAND
About nine million people in the world are considered to be deaf or dumb or both. Communications between deaf-dumb and a normal 
person have always been a challenging task. Generally dumb people use sign language for communication but they find difficulty in 
communicating with others who don’t understand sign language. This project aims to lower this barrier in communication. For this 
purpose, we have built a system that involves the following features:-
1. Precise Sign-Language Recognition - Traditionally, flex sensors have been used so far to detect the hand movements. But it has 
many limitations. It is inaccurate and gives the same value no matter where the bent is. To solve this problem, we placed 
potentiometers at every joint of our hand so that we can detect exact hand movement and convert sign language in speech(or text). 
The person has to wear the glove and he can communicate using sign language. His phone needs to have the application that will 
generate corresponding speech that the other person can listen. There is an extra option in the application i.e if the sign 
language is not interpreted correctly, he or she can write whatever he wants to say in the application and that will be converted 
into speech.
2. Alert for Deaf people - People who are deaf are generally precarious as they cannot hear fire alarms, car horns or any other 
alerts. So for this, we have embedded a microphone sensor in the glove that will respond only if  his name is called or there is 
sudden change in the amplitude of sound. This is done using sound recognition API of Google. This way we can alert them about any 
exigency around them.
